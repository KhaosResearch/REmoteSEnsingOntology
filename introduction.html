    The development of new sensors and the growing ease of access to data generated with remote sensing techniques are pushing data-driven research and the development of new innovative algorithms for its analysis. In this context, Earth Observation's satellite systems are continuously generating a great quantity of data, which are nowadays essential for applications in diverse areas, such as: climate change monitoring <em>(Plummer, Lecomte, & Doherty, 2017)</em>, precision agriculture <em>(Weiss, Jacob, & Duveiller, 2020)</em>, smart urban design <em>(Reba & Seto, 2020)</em>, and many others. This promotes the continuous generation of data-driven software facilities oriented to advanced processing, analysis and visualization, which often offer enhanced computing capabilities. However, while promising, such new-generation applications still require the symbolic representation of scenes and objects in images, as well as the setting of threshold values of computed vegetation indexes for the generation of knowledge rule systems <em>(Belgiu, Drǎguţ, & Strobl, 2014)</em>. In this regard, the development of knowledge-driven deductive methods represents an important research line in remote sensing  <em>(Arvor et al., 2019, Chen, et al., 2016)</em>, as they complement inductive data-driven techniques to make them more actionable. A significant example in this direction is GEOBIA (Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis) <em>(Blaschke, et al., 2014)</em> that allows to set objects in satellite images (based on grouping pixels according to common features) to classify them. GEOBIA enables the representation of complex spatial topological and non-topological relationships. However, as argued in the literature <em>(Arvor et al., 2019)</em> and <em>(Belgiu et al., 2014)</em>, GEOBIA rules are usually highly biased to specific scenarios and hence, they are rarely suited to be generalized. <br/>
    <br/>
    In this sense, the development of general knowledge-driven approaches constitutes an open challenge in remote sensing, besides they provide human experts with domain knowledge representation, support for data standardization and semantic integration of multiple sources, such as multi-spectral (and hyper-spectral) data from various satellites and linked open data (meteorological, plant phenotype, etc.). Therefore, there is a clear need of studying integration aspects of existing ontologies in the context of remote sensing <em>(Arvor et al., 2019)</em>, as well as to show the potentials of such integration for feeding advanced analysis. To this end, the use of ontologies and web semantic technologies has shown high success in many fields. In the specific domain of remote sensing, there are several distinct attempts of ontologies, although they still constitute local prototypes that illustrate the potential in their use <em>(Andrés et al., 2017, Arvor et al., 2019)</em>. <br/>
    <br/>
    On the basis of this necessity, this article proposes a semantic model for the consolidation, integration, reasoning and linking of data (and meta-data), in the context of satellital remote sensing products for EO. With this objective, an OWL (Web Ontology Language) <em>(Group, 2012)</em> ontology has been developed and an RDF repository has been generated to allow advanced SPARQL querying. The proposed ontology, called RESEO (REmote SEnsing Ontology), has been designed to consider remote sensing data and meta-data products in general, including satellite constellations, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), airborne, etc. For the sake of better understanding, the current study is mainly focused on the Sentinel 2 satellite mission of the Copernicus Programme of the European Space Agency (ESA), due to the growing popularity it is exhibiting among the scientific community since its launch in 2015 <em>(Pahlevan, Sarkar, Franz, Balasubramanian, & He, 2017)</em>. <br/>
