<span>
    A number of classes have been integrated from other external ontologies, although a set of new generic ones have been designed to be inherited from. This allows the ontology to be easily expanded by adding new <b>Scene</b>, <b>DataSource</b> or <b>Product</b> types depending on the specific end user's case of study. For simplicity, a selection of the most important classes of RESEO are detailed as follows: <br/>
    <br/>
    - <b>Product</b>. This class defines the data products received from the remote sensing devices, i.e., EO satellites and UAVs. Each <b>Product</b> has associated a timestamp given from the owl-TIME ontology of type time:GeneralDateTimeDescription.5 The <b>Product</b> class is modelled in this version with two subclasses, Sentinel2Product and Landsat8Product which correspond to the data sources worked at the moment in the semantic model, although it can be easily extended with more of them. A set of main object properties of the <b>Product</b> class are: hasDataSource, hasDate, hasProduct, and hasScene. Regarding data properties, they are mostly defined for the subclasses of <b>Product</b>, since they cover specific aspects of the contextual use cases where they are used. <br/>
    - <b>Data Source</b>. It represents a data provider for a <b>Product</b>. In its current state, this class has the subclass Satellite, which in turn has other two subclasses: Sentinel2 and Landsat8. However, depending on the application, it could be extended with new hierarchies of subclasses to define different sources, such as: other EO satellites (MODIS, WorldView) and UAV products. <b>DataSource</b> includes two main object properties, hasDataSource and isDataSourceOf. It is worth noting that <b>DataSource</b> can also be used as linking element with other external ontologies, since it could cover sources of data in general, but focused on contextualizing with the remote sensing domain of knowledge. In this regard, the subclass Satellite has the object property processedBy with range NDVIProcessing, which is in turn linked with classes Procedure and Observation from the SSN ontology. NDVIProcessing has the data property formula to define how the NDVI is calculated for each satellite. In this regard, a subclass of satellite is Sentinel2, which is connected to MSI, being this last a subclass of Sensor (also taken from SSN). <br/>
    - <b>Scene</b>. A <b>Scene</b> defines a region of interest with a specific location in the Earth. A scene is contained inside one or more products, which could be captured from different remote sensing devices (Sentinel 2, Landsat 8, UAVs, etc.), although referring to the same specific location and preferably to similar (or close) time instants. <b>Scene</b> is modelled as a subclass of the geosparql:Geometry class of the GeoSPARQL ontology. Object properties defined for <b>Scene</b> are: hasNearestStation hasScene and isSceneOf. Data properties of this class are defined in geosparql:Geometry. The property hasNearestStation is used as linking element with the AEMET.owl ontology that incorporates meteorological data. In this way, the <b>Scene</b> allows to integrate different sensing data referring to a specific location, for a given time period and including the specific climatic conditions, e.g., the imagery products of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 capturing the area of the Strait of Gibraltar, and including maximum and minimum temperatures during the first week of August. <br/>
    - <b>Snapshot</b>. A <b>Snapshot</b> represents the results of an analysis of a <b>Product</b>, over a concrete <b>Scene</b> of interest. The object properties of this class, namely: hasProduct, isProductOf and isSceneOf. Among the data properties, it is worth mentioning those referring to vegetation indexes, such as EVI or NDVI, which are computed with different combination of spectral bands, depending on the remote sensing devices involved in the specific <b>Scene</b> (e.g., Sentinel 2, Landsat 8, etc.). The remaining indexes (SAVI, NSDI, etc.) are defined in this class by following similar schemes of data properties as done with EVI and NDVI. In this sense, NDVI is linked with the OBOE class Characteristic and with the SWEET ontology by means of the property hasCharacteristic. Another interesting property is the cloud cover percentage in sensed images, which is often used as a threshold to select an specific product, or discard it, for the analysis. <br/>
    - <b>Entity</b>. This class has been reused from the OBOE ontology to model in RESEO those subclasses related to land-cover classification, in the current version: BareSoil, Building, Vegetation and Water. These classes are indeed subclasses of FeatureOfInterest from the SSN ontology. They are used as consequent elements in reasoning rules to perform ontology classification of remote sensing imagery. <br/>
